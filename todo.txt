try hacking an itemdrop and dumping _ENV

rework transmat terminal to use shiny new itemslot functionality so it actually acts like an inventory :D
figure out how the feck to detect if shift is held

BYOS functionality as machine
patch warp state matching into encounter variations of booster flames (/objects/ship/boosters/)
add distinguishing names to even/odd small booster flames
lots of shiny new ship components, especially animating ones that match their state to flight

some major cleanup in places
