move the business end of playerext:openInterface into a library function so panes can use it directly (while keeping things clean and easily-updatable)

configurable tram stop {
  built-in player sensor
}

reserve material ID range somewhere
semigloss black hull panel

/ figure out how the feck to detect if shift is held (done hackishly, but at least it's there)
implement slot-drop? drop into empty space, or maybe the selection icon area?
somewhat redesign UI to make better use of now-unneeded tooltip area

TERMINAL THEMABILITY?
make terminal not update every tick just for animation if it's not waiting on any players

BYOS functionality as machine {
    damageTileArea with ridiculously high strength and harvest level and radius big enough to cover a t8 vanilla ship from one end, in both fg and bg
    itemDropQuery and collect into database
    upgrade player ship to custom tier to get rid of bg image and collision material
    force-kill objects set "residual" by Hacking them and using object.smash
}
patch warp state matching into encounter variations of booster flames (/objects/ship/boosters/)
add distinguishing names to even/odd small booster flames
lots of shiny new ship components, especially animating ones that match their state to flight {
    - also floor-only teleporters (implemented as part of telepads)
}

power stuffs {
    - pure conduits to route power further and more neatly
    
    machine that powers warp core via fluxpulse (world property "ship.fuel")
    wireless charger
    
    powersuit {
        hijack tech? how much?
    }

    fluxsaber (fluxpulse-charged beamsword)
    
    intermediary pulse-battery component?
    
    powered lamp that fills a large region with full-bright light (basically volumetric lighting at the cost of fp)
    
    more smelter-type machines
    ^ chance bias stat (inverse exponent to random number)
    
    - power categories
    (move to stardustlib?)
    
    eventually make transmatter network require power (after rewrite)
}

compost bin that makes food age faster, for use as biofuel
^ some sort of powered processor to make (liquid) biodiesel?

renamer (custom shortdescription, put vanilla one as category because tooltip)

actual configurator object instead of having it in the quickbar for non-admins

some item transport for automation (and library to make use of input/output configuration)
networked wire I/O ports

make RCS tech obtainable; balance energy use

recipes {
    (all clear!)
}

clean up tinkertable categories

some major cleanup in places

probably a UI lib that encapsulates widgets (read from heirarchy)

Extend sync library {
    //Recognize RpcPromise returning another RpcPromise and replace in queue
    
    actually, response system with a proper response-message instead of just an RpcPromise
    generate responseID with makeuuid? register with an anonymous function for continuation of operation after response
}

Transmatter network reimplementation {
    Controller {
        API {
            callable via both callScriptedEntity and sendEntityMessage
            each request runs as a coroutine placed on a queue for suspendability and environment cleanliness
            
            ...
        }
        Network Scan Module {
            periodically scans the network pool, assembles the list of storage devices and notifies peripherals
        }
    }
}
