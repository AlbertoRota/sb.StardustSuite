try hacking an itemdrop and dumping _ENV

figure out how the feck to detect if shift is held
implement slot-drop
reimplement preview slot
CLEAN UP REMNANTS OF OLD TERMINAL IMPLEMENTATION
somewhat redesign UI to make better use of now-unneeded tooltip area

TERMINAL THEMABILITY?

BYOS functionality as machine
patch warp state matching into encounter variations of booster flames (/objects/ship/boosters/)
add distinguishing names to even/odd small booster flames
lots of shiny new ship components, especially animating ones that match their state to flight

some major cleanup in places

probably a UI lib that encapsulates widgets (read from heirarchy)

eventually, replace matter manipulator upgrade UI with tablet (thank you canvas-anywhere <3)
